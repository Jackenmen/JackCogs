# JackCogs
Cogs created by jack1142 (Jackenmen#6607 on Discord) for Red-DiscordBot. Red-DiscordBot is a multipurpose bot for Discord developed by Twentysix26 and the Core Developer team. Feel free to create issues, if you want to see some function in one of my cogs. If you see a bug in one of my cogs, do that as well ;)

If you're developer, you can also send pull requests and I will happily merge your commits, if it doesn't conflict with anything developed before.
